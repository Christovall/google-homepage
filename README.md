# Google Homepage Duplicate

This is a rendition of the Google homepage as seen from a US server. It's a practice project to hone HTML/CSS skills from The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css). Not perfect, but it's presentable =)

## Experience

General HTML/CSS tricks such as:
* Structuring HTML correctly
* Using unordered lists to create navigation bars
* Linking files (local and from the net)
* CSS Specificity and using it to target certain elements of HTML
* Different ways to layout using CSS's position property
* The wonders of Flexbox

On top of this I got to practice using git again which is always great. Also time management was a factor, caught myself spending too much time trying to get the styling perfect when I could've been moving onto other programming skills.

Either way this was a fun project! More to come.
